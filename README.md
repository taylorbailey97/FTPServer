# FTP Server

This is a sample FTP server program that allows the a user to add send a file through an HTTP Post request, update the file, and use a GET request to download the file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following installed before running the server
* [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - JDK 1.8 or above
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - Maven 3.2+
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Git for the command line (optional)

### Installing

First clone the repository into a directory on your computer. You do this starting from the command line, move to a folder that you would like to have the files stored at. for example: YourRootDirectory/documents. Use the command below to clone it. If you would like to avoid cloning the repository you can download the files directly [Here](https://github.com/taylorbailey97/FTPServer/archive/master.zip)

```
git clone https://github.com/taylorbailey97/FTPServer.git
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
